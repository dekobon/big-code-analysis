# Testing Rules

Project-specific testing practices for big-code-analysis. These
supplement, not replace, the test-quality lessons in
[`docs/development/lessons_learned.md`](../../docs/development/lessons_learned.md)
(particularly #6, #7, #23, #31).

## Verify defensive refactor tests by reverting the production code

When you add a regression test for a *defensive* refactor — one that
fixes no current bug but pins an invariant against future drift
(e.g., #306's `apply_suppression` Unit-kind predicate) — the test
must demonstrably fail against the pre-refactor code. A test that
passes under both the old and new implementations protects nothing.

**Verification procedure:**

1. Stash or note the production change you just made.
2. `git checkout HEAD~1 -- <file>` (or manually revert the specific
   lines).
3. Run the new test(s). Confirm they fail with the assertion message
   you expected.
4. Restore the production change.
5. Re-run the tests. Confirm they pass.

Two minutes of test-via-revert gives higher confidence than a
passing test alone — it proves the test exercises the changed line,
not an unrelated path. Without this step, defensive refactors often
ship with tests that would pass against the bug they claim to guard.

**Revert safely — a file-level restore discards your fix too.** When
the file you are perturbing also carries your *uncommitted* production
fix, `git checkout HEAD~1 -- <file>` (or any `git checkout -- <file>`)
restores the whole file and wipes the fix along with the perturbation.
This destroyed in-progress work twice in one batch (during the #605
and #615 fix sessions — commits `b8ceb8cf`, `e02ed585`; the incidents
live in the session record, not the issues); in one case the follow-up
build "passed" only because an orphaned-import warning masked the
regression. Step 1 above is therefore load-bearing,
not optional. Concretely, before perturbing a file with uncommitted
work, do one of:

- commit or `git stash push <file>` the real change first;
- apply the perturbation as a precise edit and undo it with the exact
  inverse edit — never a file-level restore;
- when a partial revert would not build, patch the production line to
  a no-op in place instead (the approach used in the #615 fix session).

After restoring, `git status` / `git diff --stat` must show exactly
the edits you intend — nothing extra, nothing missing.

Applies in particular to:

- `apply_suppression`-style "make implicit invariant explicit" fixes
- Any `matches!()` predicate tightening
- Any newly-explicit `kind` check that replaces a position-based
  index
- Test-quality follow-ups that add `check_func_space` / structural
  assertions to previously-vacuous tests (see lesson #31)

If you cannot test-via-revert because reverting the production
change does not produce a buildable tree (e.g., the change deleted a
helper the new test depends on), construct a synthetic input the
test exercises directly — do not assume the test is correct just
because it passes against the fixed code.
