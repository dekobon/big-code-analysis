//! Per-metric implementations.
//!
//! Each submodule defines one maintainability metric, its per-language
//! traits, and its `Stats` accumulator. See the crate-level docs for an
//! overview of the metric suite.

/// Divides a metric sum by a count, guarding the divisor with `.max(1)`.
///
/// Every "average over a count" metric routes through this helper so the
/// divide-by-zero guard added for [#428] is applied uniformly rather than
/// per call site. A `count` of `0` degrades to `sum / 1` (the sum itself)
/// instead of producing `inf`/`NaN`, so a never-observed or count-less
/// space still serializes a finite number.
///
/// The *meaning* of `count` is the caller's choice of denominator
/// convention; the project uses two:
///
/// - **Per-function** averages (`cognitive`, `cyclomatic`, `exit`,
///   `nargs`) divide by the function/closure count of the subtree, so the
///   value reads as "average complexity per function". `cognitive`/
///   `exit`/`nargs` source this count from `Nom`; `cyclomatic` counts its
///   own function/closure *spaces* (equal in the common case, but
///   independent of whether `Nom` is selected — see
///   `cyclomatic::Stats::function_spaces`).
/// - **Per-space** averages (`nom`, `loc`, `abc`, `tokens`) divide by the
///   total number of spaces (functions, closures, classes, the file unit,
///   …). These measure a property of each space rather than of each
///   function, so a per-function denominator would not match their
///   meaning (and for `nom` it would be circular — it *is* the function
///   count).
